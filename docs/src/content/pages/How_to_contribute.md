# How to contribute

Currently, I am maintaining ufc-api all by myself.

<br />

It would be much appreciated if you were to star it on github: https://github.com/eliasuran/ufc-api.

<br />

If you wish to contribute to ufc-api, just clone the project and make your changes in a branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliasuran/ufc-api.git
cd ufc-api
git checkout -b awesome-feature
```

When you have made your change, push the changes:

```bash
git push origin awesome-feature
```

And then make a pull request on the github website :)
